# Lume
Lume is a training planner for lifters, athletes, and anyone serious about structured fitness. Instead of juggling spreadsheets or note apps, Lume gives you a clean interface to design multi-week programs, track progress, and manage strength, cardio, mobility, or mixed sessions in one place.

You can recreate proven systems like 5/3/1, Tactical Barbell, Starting Strength, linear progression, or build your own custom periodized program. Set rep schemes, rest times, percentages, progressions, deload rules, and more—all with an interface built for actual training, not spreadsheets.

Lume keeps your training organized, predictable, and adaptable—so you can focus on getting stronger, not managing files.
